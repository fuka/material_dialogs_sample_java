# material_dialogs_sample_java

This is an example of using [afollestad/material-dialogs](https://github.com/afollestad/material-dialogs) from Java.

material-dialogs was shifted to Kotlin in version 2.0. 
Kotlin and Java are interchangeable, so you can also call them from Java.
However, the official site does not show how to use it from Java.

So, I made a sample project that summarizes how to call it from Java.
