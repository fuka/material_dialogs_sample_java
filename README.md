# material_dialogs_sample_java

This sample is using [afollestad/material-dialogs](https://github.com/afollestad/material-dialogs) with Java.

material-dialogs version 2.x is designed specifically to work with Kotlin. Also, The official site does not mention how to use in Java.

So, I summarized how to use in Java in a sample project.
